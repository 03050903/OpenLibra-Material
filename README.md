## Building my own choreography with SharedElements

Implemented a detail activity working with shared elements and animations, setting the order of each animation that composes the choreograpy, you can follow the material desing principle 'Motion provides meaning', _'All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are presented to the user without breaking the continuity of experience even as they transform and reorganize'_
